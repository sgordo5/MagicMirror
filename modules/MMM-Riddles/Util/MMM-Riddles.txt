3.Three friends check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10, totaling $30. Later, the manager realizes the room actually costs $25 and gives the bellboy $5 to return to the guests. The bellboy, however, keeps $2 for himself and gives $1 back to each guest.
Now, each guest has effectively paid $9, totaling $27. The bellboy kept $2, which adds up to $29. Where is the missing $1?
