Now, each guest has effectively paid $9, totaling $27. The bellboy kept $2, which adds up to $29. Where is the missing $1?"

answer:There is no missing dollar."

Explanation:The mistake is in how the calculation is framed. The guests paid $27, of which $25 went to the hotel and $2 to the bellboy. The question incorrectly tries to add the $2 to the total, when in reality, it's already included in the $27."
